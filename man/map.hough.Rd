\title{Tree mapping algorithm: Hough Transform}
\usage{
map.hough(hmin = 1, hmax = 3, hstep = 0.5, pixel_size = 0.025,
  max_radius = 0.25, min_density = 0.1, min_votes = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{hmin, hmax}{\code{numeric} - height thresholds within the point cloud in which circle search will be performed.}

\item{hstep}{\code{numeric} - height interval to perform circle search.}

\item{pixel_size}{\code{numeric} - pixel side length to discretize the point cloud layers while performing the Hough Transform circle search.}

\item{max_radius}{\code{numeric} - approximately the largest stem cross section radius expected in the point cloud.}

\item{min_density}{\code{numeric} - between 0 and 1 - minimum point density within a pixel evaluated on the Hough Transform - i.e. only \emph{dense} point clousters will undergo circle search.}

\item{min_votes}{\code{integer} - Hough Transform parameter - minimum number of circle intersections over a pixel to assign it as a circle center candidate.}
}
\description{
This function is meant to be used inside \code{\link{treeMap}}. It applies an adapted version of the Hough Transform for circle search. Mode details are given in the sections below.

\section{\code{LAS@data} Special Fields}{


Each point in the \code{LAS} object output represents a pixel center that is
\emph{possibly} also a stem cross-section center.

The variables describing each point in the output are:

\itemize{
\item \code{Intensity}: number of votes received by that point
\item \code{PointSourceID}: unique stem segment ID (among all trees)
\item \code{Keypoint_flag}: if \code{TRUE}, the point is the most likely circle center
of its stem segment (\code{PointSourceID})
\item \code{Radii}: approximate radius estimated by that point - always a multiple of the \code{pixel_size}
\item \code{TreeID}: unique tree ID of the point
\item \code{TreePosition}: if \code{TRUE}, the point represents its tree's approximate coordinate
}
}

\section{Adapted Hough Transform}{


The Hough Transform circle search algorithm used in
TreeLS applies a constrained circle search on discretized 
point cloud layers. Tree-wise, the circle search is  
recursive, in which the search for circle parameters 
of a stem section is constrained to the 
\emph{feature space} of the stem section underneath it.
Initial estimates of the stem's \emph{feature space} 
are performed on a \emph{baselise} stem segment - i.e.
a low height interval where a tree's bole is expected  
to be clearly visible in the point cloud.
The algorithm is described in detail by Conto et al. (2017).

This adapted version of the algorithm is very robust against outliers, 
but not against forked or leaning stems.
}

\section{Tree Selection}{


An initial tree filter is used to select \emph{probable} trees in the input point
cloud. Parallel stacked layers, each one as thick as \code{hstep}, undergo the
circle search within the \code{hmin}/\code{hmax} limits. On every layer, pixels
above the \code{min_votes} criterion are clustered, forming
\emph{probability zones}. \emph{Probability zones} vertically aligned
on at least 3/4 of the stacked layers are assigned as \emph{tree occurrence regions}
and exported in the output map.

\examples{
file = system.file("extdata", "model_boles.laz", package="TreeLS")
tls = readTLS(file)
plot(tls)

## build a 3D map of tree occurrences
map = treeMap(tls)
plot(map, color='Radii')

## get a 2D representation of the tree map
xymap = treePositions(map)
head(xymap)
